## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project was to build a fun, low-stress word game for anyone to enjoy. We wanted to build a kind of game that we would enjoy that we could share with others. It was inspired by the NYTimes Wordle. The unique combination of linguistic puzzles aims to provide a fresh and replayable experience. The game's core loop is designed to be intuitive and accessible, with a strategic layer introduced through the "energy" mechanic.
