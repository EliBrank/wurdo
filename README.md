## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project was to build a fun, low-stress word game for anyone to enjoy. We wanted to build a kind of game that we would enjoy that we could share with others. It was inspired by the NYTimes Wordle. The unique combination of linguistic puzzles aims to provide a fresh and replayable experience. The game's core loop is designed to be intuitive and accessible, with a strategic layer introduced through the "energy" mechanic.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - `React`: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
  - `Tailwind CSS`: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
  - `Vercel` : Vercel is a cloud platform that enables developers to deploy and hostwebsites and web services instantly, primarily focusing on frontend       frameworks and serverless functions for maximum speed and scalability.
  - `Next.JS` : Vercel is a cloud platform that enables developers to deploy and host websites and web services instantly, primarily focusing on frontend frameworks and serverless functions for maximum speed and scalability.

- **Backend & Data:**
  - `Python`: The backend language for scripts, microservices and features of the game.
  - `Redis`: Used as a high-performance in-memory data store.

### Prerequisites

* `Python 3.x`: ...
* `Node.js` & `npm`: ...
* `Redis Server`: ...

### Backend Setup
There are a number of libraries that we are utilizing to import words and have a full library. They are listed in requirements and requirements-runtime files. To run the game and have access to all features, you must install these packages.

## Usage

To run the program there will be different methods.

## Project Status
Currently, our project has two working interfaces in VScode that allows the game to be played at a terminal level.
we have quite a lot of files that need to be tidied up and there is a small amount of stretch goal and feature
functionality that has not yet been attained. We have our High Fidelity MVP in a working state right now.
Multiple members of our team have been able to play the game on their machine with a minimum of setup.
